        <h2>What to Expect</h2>
            <p> This burger recipe has "killer" in the name for two primary reasons.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>It may increase your health metrics to disasterous levels if consumed too frequently.</li>
                <li>It will be DELICIOUS.</li>
            </ul>
        <p>If you understand the risks, and value tantalizing your tastebuds, dive in!</p>

        <p>
            We encourage you to customize this recipe as you see fit. The ingredients and process are absolutely customizable, however we suggest you stay the course as closely as possible on your first go-round. Once you have successfully created a killer burger as we suggest, go hog-wild with customizations.
